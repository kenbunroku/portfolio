        <p>
          This project was a product evaluation research in 2016 when a new
          Prius was launched. I was assigned the project just after moving to
          the Market Research group in Toyota.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the product-centered research which was originally
          requested by client departments, I conducted the market-centered
          research to understand how the market changed from when Prius was
          introduced for the first time, and grasp a gap between the current
          market and Toyota about High-tech car and Environmental-friendly car.
          The purpose of this research was to consider the result into next
          model's concept.

          <div class="small-box">
            <p>
              In Toyota, a renewed model would be evaluated by user research
              after it is introduced to the market in order to conider next
              model change.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2016, I was in the Research Dept. of Japan HQ and assinged to
              conduct user research to evaluate 4th generataion of Prius which
              was debuted in the same year in U.S and Japan. It was a big
              cross-functional project and I collaborated with the Engineering
              Dept, the Design Dept., the Marketing Dept. andthe Product
              planning Dept. both in U.S. and Japan.
            </p>
            <p>
              The members biggest concern was why sales result of the new
              generation was lower than that of previous one.

          <div>
            <p>
              At first, I organized communication routes from other departments
              and set 3 main routes. I asked the Marketing in Japan HQ and US
              office to discuss with other departments, summerize the requests
              for the research, and inform me. Also, I discussed the research
              scheme with the Research Dept. in US who negotiated with a
              research agency.
            </p>
            <p>
              This worked well because of 2 reasons. First, it was efficient
              since I was not obsessed with answering all the requests from each
              department. Second, this organization helped other departments
              avoid misunderstanding or miscommunication.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Additionally, I set milestone meetings with all of the department to
            decide the research scheme. That helped us avoid confusion,
            misunderstanding, miscommunication and untrustness, which often
            happened in other projects and resulted in schedule delays.

        <p class="text-box">
          Prius sales has decreased since ‘11 while alternative fuel car market
          has expanded. It was critical for the company because not only Toyota
          would lose their sales volume, but also the model led a brand image of
          environmental friendly, advanced-tech. We needed to analyze the causes
          to regain Toyota brand image and share in the market.

        <div class="text-box">
          <p>
            The hypothesis of other departments why the sales did not go well
            was that a product feature such as design or function was not good.
            However, after analyzing historical data of quantitative research
            about people who bought the model, I came up with a differenct
            perspective.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found the fact that Prius image of Eco friendly and innovative
            kept decreasing even though Fuel Economy and hybrid technology were
            improved. I assumed that market condition or expectation had changed
            and the model's core values might not have matched them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I persuaded other departments to conduct the research to check not
            only the product features but also the market condition with my
            analysis.

        <p class="text-box">
          I decided to inplement Focus Groups to get diverse & broad customers’
          opinions about Alt. Fuel Car, Advanced Car and Prius core values.
          Also, I planned to conduct Home visit interview to probe customer
          opinions more clearly and more deeply through their lifestyle as
          contexts.
        </p>

        <h4>Recruiting</h4>
        <p class="text-box">
          I made 5 categories for Focus Groups, Prius loyal customers who prefer
          advanced-tech, those who prefer ecology, people inflowed to or
          outflowed from Prius and Alt. fuel car customers. They allowed us to
          evaluate the latest model objectively with both positive and negative
          opinions. For home visit interview, I decided to choose 1 person from
          each group who is the most interesting.

          answers we could get?" to make effective questionnaire.

          Particularly, meetings after the interviews worked well to summerize
          what we took, keep improving a interview flow and move on

          in the current context, both in US and Japan. Also, by collaborating
          with the product planning team, we proposed what concept ideas we

            In addition to customer insight, from marketing point of view, I
            analyzed why prius share decreased and reported it at an executive
            meeting. With quantitative data, I showed historical trend and how
            much it decreased. Also, I added qualitative data, comments from the
            customer interview, to prove the credibility. I explained to whom
            and what product features the company should focus on to increase
            its market share.

            The executives agreed with the result and the marketing dept. and
