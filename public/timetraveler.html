              "Time Traveler in Chicago" gives commuters and tourists opportunities of enjoying,experiencing and learning about the history of Chicago. The app projects old pictures on a window which
              were taken at the same location where a bus is running.

            It is my individual project. After analyzing wireframes of current
            movie apps, I've done rapid prototyping with Sketch and Principle.

              There are two types of the target user. First one is commuters who get bored at looking at the same scenery in their daily life. The first goal of the app is to entertain them and get rid of theire pressures or stresses with dynamic interaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second user is travelers. The app enriches their travel experiences to help them explore not only current city views but also those in the past, which encourage them to understand history of a city they visit in a limited amount of time.

            <p>On a bus window, first of all, the users can tap a clock icon to choose time they want to travel. Time is shown on a sequential bar because time flow is linear.</p>
            <p>After selecting, the users would travel to the time by annimation. The annimation is inspired by time travel scenes in works that I watched or played when I was a child, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doraemon">Doraemon </a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/613830/CHRONO_TRIGGER/">Chrono Trigger</a> .</p>
          </div>
          <div class="right-desc">
            <p>A past photo which was taken near the user current location would be shown on a window. The users can use a a slider to switch the screen between a past view and a current view, which is more interactive and dynamic inspired by some file comparison apps such as <a href="https://kaleidoscope.app/">Kaleidoscope</a> or <a href="https://codepen.io/tutsplus/pen/bWKMoK">Split-Screen UI</a></p>
            <p>The users capture the photo to explore the information. One category should be selected from Architecture, Food and Fashion. When the users tap a magnifier, an object becomes colorful and its details are popped up.</p>

          <p>❌ Circular time option did not look intuitive since time flow is linear</p>
