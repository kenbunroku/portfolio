                    <p>
                        I used this model invented by B.J.Fogg, an American social scientist and the founder and director of the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab to decide how to approch the problems.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since a partner of the target user is lack of ability to be aware of when to clean the house, while the person agrees to do housework, I set increasing the ability as the first goal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second goal is to increase the motivation to keep doing housework to palce the behavior on the ideal behavior.

                        To define new and effective behaviors to achieve the goal, I used this 2x2 that aligns impact and easeness of behaviors as axis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I chose a log to increase awareness of housework, and chose media such as pictures and videos to educate housework skills.

                    <p>I used O / C Matrix to consider how to transact from complying change to behavior and attitude change, and how to make a behavioral cycle from forming outcome to alterning and reinforcing outcome.</p>
