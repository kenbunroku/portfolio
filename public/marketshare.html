                        I was an original member in a team of two who made this dashboard, analyzed marketing data and its data structure, decided visualization, and created the report to present executives.

                        Before this project, I reported product satisfaction from customer surveys to discuss product improvement with the engineering dept., the marketing dept., and executives who were in charge of them to increase the market share.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, it was not easy for them to agree on the data and my conclusion because they wondered that there might have been other factors which affected the market share. I had to show a whole picture around the market share to get their agreement and have constructive discussions.</p>

                            First of all, I constructed a whole dataset from a big picture to details. I broke down the global market share change into that in each major country for the company to detect where problems exist.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Synthesize product, sales, and brand data to analyze the market share in each country from comprehensive and broader points of view.
                        </p>
                        <p style="padding-bottom: 100px;">
                            Their data sources are customer surveys and subscripted data from <a href="https://ihsmarkit.com/industry/automotive.html">IHS Markit</a>, one of the famous automotive data suppliers. I processed those data to make them the best match with the purpose and context.

                            When the weighted average of customer satisfaction has a problem, dig it into main models and their features to grasp the problem more specifically.

                        <p>I started the dashboard from the historical global sales and market share to show a whole picture first and make it easy to understand the situation considering the market share should be evaluated in its trend as they are relative data, not abusolute. And then, I broke them into the share in each country comparing with that of major competitors.</p>
                        <p>In addition, at the left bottom, I also caluculated how the share change was caused by dividing a whole change into market volume change and market share change in each market. That helped to more clearly show the seriousness of the market share decrease in the major markets.</p>

                        The executives, the engineering dept., and the marketing dept. understood and agreed on the product issues. Until when I left the company, I saw them moving the discussion forward to how to improve the issues and to take marketing strategies to regain the market share.
