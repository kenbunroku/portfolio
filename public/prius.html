          This project was a product evaluation research in 2016 when a new
          Prius was launched. I was assigned the project just after moving to
          the Market Research group in Toyota.
        </p>
        <p class="long-box2">
          In addition to the product-centered research which was originally
          requested by client departments, I conducted the market-centered
          research to understand how the market changed from when Prius was
          introduced for the first time, and grasp a gap between the current
          market and Toyota about High-tech car and Environmental-friendly car.
          The purpose of this research was to consider the result into next
          model's concept.

              In Toyota, a renewed model would be evaluated by user research after it is introduced to the market in order to conider next model change.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2016, I was in the Research Dept. of Japan HQ and assinged to conduct user research to evaluate 4th generataion of Prius which was debuted in the same year in U.S and Japan. It was a big cross-functional project and I collaborated with the Engineering Dept, the Design Dept., the Marketing Dept. andthe Product planning Dept. both in U.S. and Japan.
            </p>
            <p>
              The members biggest concern was why sales result of the new
              generation was lower than that of previous one.

          <div class="long-box1">
            <p>
              At first, I organized communication routes from other departments
              and set 3 main routes. I asked the Marketing in Japan HQ and US
              office to discuss with other departments, summerize the requests
              for the research, and inform me. Also, I discussed the research
              scheme with the Research Dept. in US who negotiated with a
              research agency.
            </p>
            <p>
              This worked well because of 2 reasons. First, it was efficient
              since I was not obsessed with answering all the requests from each
              department. Second, this organization helped other departments
              avoid misunderstanding or miscommunication.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, I set milestone meetings with all of the department to decide the research scheme. That helped us avoid confusion,
              misunderstanding, miscommunication and untrustness, which often
              happened in other projects and resulted in schedule delays.

        <div class="grid-3-container">
          <p class="box1">
            Prius sales has decreased since ‘11 while alternative fuel car market
            has expanded. It was critical for the company because not only Toyota
            would lose their sales volume, but also the model led a brand image of environmental friendly, advanced-tech. We needed to analyze the causes to regain Toyota brand image and share in the market.
          </p>
          <img src="./assets/images/prius/prius-6.png" alt="current situation1" class="box2" />

          <div class="long-box1">
            <p>
              The hypothesis of other departments why the sales did not go well
              was that a product feature such as design or function was not good.
              However, after analyzing historical data of quantitative research
              about people who bought the model, I came up with a differenct
              perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
              I found the fact that Prius image of Eco friendly and innovative
              kept decreasing even though Fuel Economy and hybrid technology were
              improved. I assumed that market condition or expectation had changed
              and the model's core values might not have matched them.
            </p>
            <p>
              I persuaded other departments to conduct the research to check not
              only the product features but also the market condition with my
              analysis.

              evaluate the latest model objectively with both positive and negative
