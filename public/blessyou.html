                    <p>
                        Superheros are always busy.
                        They never stop fighting against villain to save people. Yet, they are also humans whereas they have superpower. They are beyond fatigue and extremely exhausted due to never ending patrol activities.
                        One day, one of the superheroes gets a sick because of the chronic fatigue. His superpower is restricted to high jump only when he sneezes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, he must keep working to save people who need his help. Villains will not wait for him until he recovers from the illness. Now, he gets a call to rescue kidnapped citizens who is tied up on the rooftop of tall buildings. Villains set a trap to kill him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He cannot lose this challenge...

                    <p>The player requires to go up to a top of each stage to save a kidnapped child from a villain. There are traps such as spike that damage the hero's life. The player has to avoid touching the traps 3 times.</p>
                    <p>On the left top on the screen, there is a life gauge and a sneeze bar whose mecanism will be explained later.</p>

                    <p>The sneeze bar endlessly goes to zero and back to full every 2 seconds. When it reaches zero, the hero does "Sneeze Jump" because he cannot control his power appropriately.</p>
                    <p>The sneeze jump enables the hero to go up to a higher place when he is at the middle of normal jump, which gives the player a strategy to consider when to jump.</p>

                        <p>Game level was taken into consideration when I made the background. I tried not making the stage too difficult since it would be the first stage. Also, I intended to put the elements to get the player understand the basic game mechanism and how to play.</p>
